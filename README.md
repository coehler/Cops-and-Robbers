# Cops and Robbers

A cops and robbers shootout game developed in C# for Unity 2018.

## Description

This was a project written over the period of a month in the summer of 2019 as a way to explore the fundamentals of Unity game design. It was written largely by myself with some artistic support from friends.

Cops and Robbers is dependent on several third party proprietary scripts and art assets that had to be removed for the public release. As such, this repo will not compile and is meant for educational purposes only. 

However, the development of Cops and Robbers was documented in several videos available [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6zTG9s6aj0JbdW97-vmJ4oNz-C5spUfB)
